        <h2>Cookies and website usage data</h2>
        <p>
          Our website uses “cookies” and similar technologies to collect
          information about your computer’s or device’s browser, usage of the
          site, pages visited, time spent, and other analytics data. A cookie is

          us access to your computer or any information about you except the
          data you choose to share. We use traffic log cookies to identify which
          pages are being used and to help us analyse website traffic to improve
          the site. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers
          automatically accept cookies but you can usually modify your browser
          settings to decline cookies. However, declining cookies may prevent
          you from taking full advantage of the website.

        <h2>Disclosure of personal information</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third
          parties unless we have your permission or are required by law.
        </p>
        <p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            our related companies, contractors or service providers who assist
            us in operating our website, conducting our business or servicing

          <li>
            government or regulatory authorities, if required by law.
            <br />
            If we transfer personal information to a third-party overseas, we
            will take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient
            complies with the APPs or similar standards.

          safeguard and secure the personal information we collect online, and
          to protect it from unauthorised access, modification, disclosure or
          destruction.
          <br />Despite our efforts, no internet or email transmission is ever
          completely secure or error-free, so we cannot guarantee absolute
          security.
