            </li>

            <li><h2>DELIVERY, FREIGHT AND RISK</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        6.1 The Customer is solely responsible for selecting a freight carrier within the Mediapoint website and ordering portal. Mediapoint may offer several carrier options, which may change over time at Mediapoint’s discretion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6.2 The Customer must correctly designate whether the delivery address is business or residential. Any additional fees, surcharges, or re-delivery costs arising from incorrect address classification or incomplete delivery information will be charged to the Customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6.3 All delivery and contact details entered at the time of ordering must be complete and accurate. Because Mediapoint’s production and dispatch systems are automated, delivery addresses, contact details, shipping labels, and delivery instructions cannot be added, amended, or changed after the order is submitted. Mediapoint accepts no responsibility for delays, mis-deliveries, or surcharges resulting from incorrect or incomplete information supplied by the Customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6.4 Risk in the Goods transfers to the Customer immediately upon collection by the freight carrier or by the Customer from Mediapoint’s premises, whichever occurs first. Once the Goods have left Mediapoint’s facility, the Customer assumes full responsibility for loss, damage, delay, or delivery issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6.5 Mediapoint is not liable for freight delays, carrier handling errors, or delivery failures of any kind. All delivery dates displayed within the portal are indicative only and not guaranteed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6.6 A consignment will not be considered lost until the nominated carrier formally declares it lost in writing, which may take several weeks or months. Recourse or credit for lost freight will only be considered once the carrier’s investigation and claim process are fully completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6.7 Mediapoint will not be liable for any consequential or indirect loss, missed deadlines, customer commitments, or loss of profit resulting from freight delay, damage, or non-delivery, regardless of cause.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>
                        7.1 All production and turnaround times shown on the portal are estimates only.

                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        7.3 Because the workflow is fully automated, no cancellations, changes, or stops can be made once the order is approved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        7.4 Cancelling an in-progress job would require interrupting entire print runs and manually intervening in prepress, affecting multiple customers; therefore, such cancellations are not possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        7.5 Any customer notes, comments, or special instructions entered within the ordering portal will be automatically disregarded. The Mediapoint system does not support or action order-specific notes, and by placing an order the customer acknowledges and agrees that all production will proceed solely according to the selections made within the system interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        8.3 The customer acknowledges and agrees that Mediapoint cannot halt or amend production once the order has entered the automated queue.

                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        9.4 Mediapoint may refuse to print any artwork it deems unlawful, defamatory, obscene, unethical, or otherwise inappropriate, including but not limited to material that depicts harm, discrimination, or illegal activity.

                        11.1 Colours may vary between materials, print runs, or printing equipment due to differences in ink formulation, substrate properties, environmental conditions, and calibration. Such variations are inherent in the print process and are not considered defects.

                    <li>
